Welcome to my project, the Animated Bubbles Landing Page! This project leverages the power of CSS animations and HTML5 to create an engaging and dynamic landing page.

Description
-----------
The landing page features a background of animated bubbles, created using CSS keyframes and animation properties, which gives the webpage an interactive and lively feel.

You can either double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your default web browser, or you can open it from your web browser's file menu.

File Structure
--------------

* `index.html` - This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage.
* `styles.css` - This file contains the styling and animations for the webpage.

Key Features
------------
* Animated bubbles: The landing page features animated bubbles that move across the screen. These animations are purely CSS-based, making them lightweight and performant.

Customization
-------------
If you want to customize the animations or styles, you can modify the `styles.css` file. In particular, you can change the following:

* Bubble animation speed: Modify the duration parameter in the `animation` property inside the `.bubble` class.
* Bubble size: Change the `width` and `height` properties in the `.bubble` class.
* Bubble color: Modify the `background-color` property in the `.bubble` class.
